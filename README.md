## üõ†Ô∏è Technology stack

### Backend Service (Java)

- Java 24.0.1
- Spring Boot 3.5.5
- Spring Data JPA - for working with the database
- H2 Database - embedded database for development
- Maven - for project build purposes

### ML Service (Python)

- Python 3.12.5
- Django 5.2.6 - web framework
- Django REST Framework (DRF) - for building a REST API
- SQLite - the default database for development
- Pip - for dependency management

### General Tools

- Git - version control
- Docker - containerization
- Docker Compose - container orchestration
- Postman - API testing

### üìä Functionality

### Current Functionality (Week 1)

- Backend Service: CRUD operations for books (create, read, update, delete) via REST API
- ML Service:  CRUD operations for books (create, read, update, delete) via REST API, search for similar books
- Interaction between microservices

### Planned Functionality

- Integration of an ML model for book genre prediction
- Application containerization using Docker
- CI/CD setup with GitHub Actions

## üöÄ Installation and launch

### Prerequisites

- Install Java 24.0.1 or OpenJDK 24
- Install Python 3.12.5
- Install Git

### Starting the Backend Service (Java)

```bash
cd backend-service
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The service will be accessible at the following address: http://localhost:8080

### Starting the ML Service (Python)

1. Go to the directory ml-service:
```bash
cd ml-service
```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # for Linux/macOS
# or
venv\Scripts\activate      # for Windows
```
3. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Apply the migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
5. Start the server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The service will be accessible at the following address: http://localhost:8000

## üì° API

### Backend Service (Java)

- GET /api/books - Get all books
- POST /api/books - Create a new book
- GET /api/books/{id} - Get book by ID
- PUT /api/books/{id} - Update book by ID
- DELETE /api/books/{id} - Delete a book by ID
- GET /api/genres/predictGenre - Get the predicted book genre

Example of a request body for creating a book (JSON):
```json
{
  "title": "The title of the book",
  "author": "The author of the book",
  "publicationYear": 2023,
  "pages": 120,
  "rating": 4.1
}
```

Example of an HTTP request for genre prediction:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/genres/predictGenre?title=Python+Programming
```

### ML Service (Python)

- GET /api/books/ - Get all books
- POST /api/books/ - Create a new book
- GET /api/books/{id}/ - Get book by ID
- PUT /api/books/{id}/ - Update book by ID
- DELETE /api/books/{id}/ - Delete a book by ID
- GET /api/predict?title=Book+Title - Predict genre
- GET /api/books/similar/{book_id}/ - Get similar books

Example of a request body for creating a book (JSON):
```json
{
  "title": "The title of the book",
  "author": "The author of the book",
  "publication_year": 2022,
  "pages": 240,
  "rating": 4.2
}
```

Example of an HTTP request for genre prediction:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/predict?title=Python+Programming
```

## üß™ Testing the Integration

1. Start both services
2. Predict genre using the Python service from Java service:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/genres/predictGenre?title=Python+Programming
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use Error

If port 8080 or 8000 is occupied, change the port in the settings:

**Java-service**: add to application.properties:
```properties
server.port=8081
```
**Python-service**: run with a different port:
```bash
python manage.py runserver 8001
```

### Database connection errors

Make sure that the database is running and accessible.
